How does it work?

Clients can stake their Dai in the pool of my website, and there's a script I can run that goes through all the people that have staked in the pool and gives them ArkToken.
eg: you have 100 Dai in the pool, you get 100 ArkToken.
PS: I use mDai instead of Dai since I'm not connected to the global blockchain. mDai is a mock Dai Token that acts the same way as Dai.


How to Run?

You need to install Ganache in order to run a local blockchain.
Then connect your MetaMask to the Ganache server.
Finally dont forget to deploy the contracts.

What Next?

There are 2 smart contracts in my code that have not been deployed. Both are NFT's that I am currently developping and learning how to develop.
I expect in a week or 2 to have 1 completed.
